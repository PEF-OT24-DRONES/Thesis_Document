In this section, the achievements of the thesis are summarized, from the design and fabrication of the modular charging station to the instrumentation of the drone with localization sensors and a computer vision system. The objectives were successfully met, highlighting the modularity and efficiency of the proposed charging system, as well as the successful integration of the drone with the charging station.

Despite the accomplishments, areas for improvement were identified for future work. Among these enhancements is the implementation of a fast-charging system, which would significantly reduce the drone's charging time. Additionally, developing an autonomous lighting system to ensure precise landing in low-light conditions would improve the drone's operational autonomy in various scenarios.

Finally, optimizing the communication system between the drone and the charging station could increase the efficiency of the landing and charging process, particularly when operating multiple stations in a swarm environment.
