abstract="Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) is a method of serial communication allowing two different components on a device to talk to each other without the requirement of a clock. We consider UART in depth in this chapter as it is one of the most popular communication interfaces that has great significance in IoT security and penetration testing. There is also something known as Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (USART), which transmits data both synchronously and asynchronously depending on the requirement; however, we have not seen a lot of devices using it. For that reason, we won't be covering USART, and focus instead on UART.",

abstract="The Serial Peripheral Interface Bus (SPI) is a means of communicating between the CPU and the peripheral devices. It is very simple to operate and is used for a variety of devices that connect to the physical world. SD cards, touch screens, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and analog-to-digital convertors (ADCs) are commonly connected to an SPI bus for extending embedded systems.",

abstract="Inter integrated circuit (I2C) is a synchronous serial communication protocol. It is developed for serial communication between electronic devices. I2C is an 8-bit oriented communication protocol. I2C communication employs two wires for communication. I2C synchronous communication protocol has been developed by the Philips company in 1982. It is widely used for connecting low-speed peripheral devices to more complex electronic devices such as processors and microcontrollers for short-distance or intra-board communications. Several versions of I2C protocol have been released in time. In 2007, the version 3.0 was introduced. Version 4, which adds 5Â Mbit/s ultra fast-mode, is introduced in 2012. In 2014, the last revision, version 6, was released. In this chapter, we first explain the I2C communication, then provide information about VHDL implementation of I2C communication protocol. We further explain the subject using clear examples.",

abstract="In this chapter, we look at using serial communication protocols. In the realm of embedded systems and microcontroller applications, the ability to communicate effectively with external devices is fundamental. Serial communication is the lifeblood of embedded systems, allowing microcontrollers to interact with many external devices and peripherals. The most ubiquitous of these are USART, SPI, and I2C, which I will be explaining in this chapter. We will embark on a journey to demystify these protocols, breaking down their functionalities, configurations, and applications. The applications we cover using sensors, GPS, GSM, and a host of other things once we have learned how to use these protocols will give you hands-on experience in using these devices in your applications. So grab a bottle of water and sit down. This will be a long one. By the end of this chapter, you will get a solid grasp of serial communications setting the stage for exciting projects and innovations in your embedded systems journey. Let's get started!",
